# Effective Akka Http - Example Code

This is the example code used during the [Effective Akka Http Talk](https://talks.virtual-void.net/effective-akka-http-2016/#/) given at the
Reactive Systems Hamburg Meetup on 2016-11-09.

The master branch contains the prepared examples. The `end-result` branch contains
the results of the live-hacking during the talk.

Use `sbt` to start an sbt shell. Then run `compile` and `run-main <tab>` to find an
example to execute.
